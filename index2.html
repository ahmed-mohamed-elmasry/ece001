   (AI) the use of sophisticated algorithms and software in healthcare to simulate human cognition in the study, interpretation and understanding of complicated medical and healthcare data. Specifically, AI is computer algorithm capability to approximate conclusions without direct human input.
What distinguishes AI technology from traditional technologies in health care is the ability to gain information, process it and give a well-defined output to the end-user. AI does this through machine learning algorithms and deep learning. These algorithms can recognize patterns in behavior and create their own logic. In order to reduce the margin of error, AI algorithms need to be tested repeatedly. AI algorithms behave differently from humans in two ways: (1) algorithms are literal: if you set a goal, the algorithm can't adjust itself and only understand what it has been told explicitly, (2) and some deep learning algorithms are black boxes; algorithms can predict extremely precise, but not the cause or the why.

        The ability to interpret imaging results with radiology may aid clinicians in detecting a minute change in an image that a clinician might accidentally miss. A study at Stanford created an algorithm that could detect pneumonia at that specific site, in those patients involved, with a better average F1 metric (a statistical metric based on accuracy and recall), than the radiologists involved in that trial. Several companies (icometrix, QUIBIM, Robovision, ...) have popped up that offer AI platforms for uploading images to. There are also vendor-neutral systems like UMC Utrecht's MAGR AI. . These platforms are trainable through deep learning to detect a wide range of specific diseases and disorders. The radiology conference Radiological Society of North America has implemented presentations on AI in imaging during its annual meeting. The emergence of AI technology in radiology is perceived as a threat by some specialists, as the technology can achieve improvements in certain statistical metrics in isolated cases, as opposed to specialists.

        There are many diseases and there also many ways that AI has been used to efficiently and accurately diagnose them. Some of the diseases that are the most notorious such as Diabetes, and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) which are both in the top ten for causes of death worldwide have been the basis behind  a lot of the research/testing to help get an accurate diagnosis. Due to such a high mortality rate being associated with these diseases there have been efforts to integrate various methods in helping get accurate diagnosis’.

        An article by Jiang, et al. (2017) demonstrated that there are several types of AI techniques that have been used for a variety of different diseases. Some of these techniques discussed by Jiang, et al. include: Support vector machines, neural networks, Decision trees, and many more. Each of these techniques is described as having a “training goal” so “classifications agree with the outcomes as much as possible…”.
        
        To demonstrate some specifics for disease diagnosis/classification there are two different techniques used in the classification of these diseases include using “Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bayesian Networks (BN)”. From a review of multiple different papers within the timeframe of 2008-2017 observed within them which of the two techniques were better.  The conclusion that was drawn was that “the early classification of these  diseases can be achieved developing machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Network and Bayesian Network.”  Another conclusion Alic, et al. (2017) was able to draw was that between the two ANN and BN that ANN was better and could more accurately classify diabetes/CVD with a mean accuracy in “both cases (87.29 for diabetes and 89.38 for CVD)

    <font size="5" face="calibri"> 
        DSP-1181, a molecule of the drug for OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) treatment, was invented by artificial intelligence through joint efforts of Exscientia (British start-up) and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma (Japanese pharmaceutical firm). The drug development took a single year, while pharmaceutical companies usually spend about five years on similar projects. DSP-1181 was accepted for a human trial.
