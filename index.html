     <b>Artificial Intelegence</b> (AI) : Refers to human intelligence simulation in machines which are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.
The term may also apply to any machine that exhibits human mind-related traits such as learning and problem-solving.

The ideal feature of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take action that has the best chance of attaining a specific objective.

   The first thing that most people usually think of when they hear the term artificial intelligence is robots. This is because large-budget movies and novels weave stories
Of the human machines that wreak havoc on Earth. There could be nothing further from the truth, however.

Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in such a way as to be easily imitated and executed by a machine,
From the easiest down to the more complicated ones. Artificial intelligence targets include learning, reasoning, and perception.
         
   Previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated as technology advances. Machines for example, which calculate basic functions
Or recognizing text through optimum character recognition is no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since that feature is now taken for granted as an intrinsic machine function.

AI is evolving continuously to benefit a lot of different industries. Machines are wired using a mathematics, computer science , linguistics, psychology and more based cross-disciplinary approach.

    <font size="5" face="calibri">
        In this brief history , science, poetry, and imagination are traced to the origins of artificial intelligence. AI was inspired by early developments in electronics, engineering, and many other disciplines.
Some early milestones include work on problems that included basic work on learning , knowledge representation, and inference, as well as language understanding, translation, demonstration programmes,
Proof theorem, associative memory, and knowledge based systems. The article ends with a brief review of the influential organizations and current challenges facing the field.

The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs
 and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.

Many examples of artificial intelligence technology include chess-playing computers and < a href="https:/en.wikipedia.org / wiki / history of self-driving cars">self-driving cars</a >
. Each of these machines has to weigh the consequences of any measures they take,
As any move affects the end result. In chess, game winning is the end result. The computer system will account for all external data for the self-driving cars
And measure it to behave in a way that would avoid a collision.
         
Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage
 and large account depositsâ€”all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.

        Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI">Weak artificial intelligence</a>  embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job.
         Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's <a href="https://www.alexa.com/"> Alexa</a> and Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/siri/">Siri</a> . You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.

         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI">Strong artificial intelligence</a>  systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems.
         They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in <a href="https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/buildings/markets/smart-hospitals/operating-room.html"> hospital operating rooms</a>.
